"""
Single abstraction for all human-facing CLI console output.

cli.py previously called typer.echo/secho ad hoc per command, which is why
some commands (init, generate) were colored and others (lint, graph) printed
everything in plain, undifferentiated text. Every command should route
through these four functions so severity is always visually distinct and
the "[gitscribe]" prefix is applied in exactly one place.

Not a replacement for telemetry.py: that module is structured, file-backed
logging of LLM call metadata (JSONL, for later analysis). This module is
ephemeral, human-facing terminal output. Different concern, not a duplicate.
